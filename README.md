Parking Lot project

This is to help our friend Jimmy fill up his parking lot. There is a ParkingLot class that has a find_parking_spot method; this method will find the first available spot on the lowest floor that's big enough to fit the vehicle.

There is also a MultiVehicleSpot which will maximize the profits for an individual spot by filling it with the most expensive cars.
